I am a third-year graduate student from [East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST)](https://www.ecust.edu.cn/main.htm), supervised by [Prof. Yang Tang (IEEE Fellow)](http://www.ytangecust.com/). My research interest includes autonomous navigation, motion planning and control, and mobile robotics.
