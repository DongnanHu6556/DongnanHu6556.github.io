Research experience
======
* "Motion Planning and Control of Hybrid Flying-Crawling Quadrotors", June 2022- November 2023
  * I proposed a planner that generates hybrid terrestrial-aerial trajectories satisfying the kinematic and dynamic requirements of the multimodal quadrotors.
  * Given the reliance on flight autopilots for crawling motions, quadrotors cannot independently adjust the speeds of every motor. I developed a controller enabling ground trajectory tracking within this constraint.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Yang Tang
